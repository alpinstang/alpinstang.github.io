---

I started on C, Rails, and Java, to a full serverless stack using python and nodeJS Lambdas, S3, DynamoDB, ReactJS and Angular2+ based frameworks. I have also done extensive custom plugin development for Wordpress customers. I am accustomed to wearing many hats, and can balance tasks effectively. I am quick to learn on the fly and willing and able to exceed expectations.

My current expertise is based in ReactJS / React Native, and Cloud platform integrations. I am open to team feedback and my goal is continued growth.
### More Information
