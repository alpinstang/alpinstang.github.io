I was having endless trouble with my test runner in my React app, and it was causing my build pipeline to fail as well. After a few hours of reading documents and cobbling answers from around the forums I found a solution. There are several places I needed to configure correctly. I'm listing them out below for anyone else that has this error and is not having any luck with other answers.

Setup your package.json to include these dependencies, and jest configuration:
```json
"devDependencies": {
    "@babel/plugin-transform-runtime": "^7.12.10",
    "@babel/preset-env": "7.12.11",
    "@babel/preset-react": "7.12.10",
    "babel-jest": "26.6.3",
    "babel-plugin-transform-class-properties": "^6.24.1",
    "chai": "^4.2.0",
    "enzyme": "^3.11.0",
    "enzyme-adapter-react-16": "^1.15.5",
    "enzyme-to-json": "^3.6.1",
    "jest": "26.6.3",
    "node-sass": "4.14.1",
    "react-test-renderer": "17.0.1",
    "redux-mock-store": "^1.5.4"
  },

...other stuff---

"jest": {
    "moduleNameMapper": {
      "\\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|eot|otf|webp|svg|ttf|woff|woff2|mp4|webm|wav|mp3|m4a|aac|oga)$": "<rootDir>/__mocks__/fileMock.js",
      "\\.(css|less|scss)$": "<rootDir>/__mocks__/styleMock.js"
    }
  }
```

Basic test:
```js
// <rootdir>/__tests__/app.test.js
import React from "react";
import { assert } from "chai";
import { shallow, configure } from "enzyme";
import Adapter from "enzyme-adapter-react-16";
import configureMockStore from "redux-mock-store";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";

import App from "../src/App"; // Component to Test

configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });

const mockStore = configureMockStore();
const store = mockStore({});

describe("Test Component", () => {
  it("render correctly App component", () => {
    const AppComponent = shallow(
      <Provider store={store}>
        <App />
      </Provider>
    ).exists();
    assert(AppComponent === true);
  });
});
```
Add these styleMock and filemock modules to prevent errors on jsx components importing css/scss and/or files:
```js
// <rootdir>/__mocks__/styleMock.js
module.exports = {};

// <rootdir>/__mocks__/fileMock.js
module.exports = "test-file-stub";
```
```js
// <rootdir>/babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"],
  plugins: [
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties",
    "@babel/plugin-transform-runtime",
  ],
};

```
👩‍💻👨‍💻 ...and _now_ you should be able to run your tests with jest + enzyme, and in my case, chai.
