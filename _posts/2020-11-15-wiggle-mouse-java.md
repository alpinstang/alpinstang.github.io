# WIggle Mouse
### Built in java for portability.
> Functionality: Wiggle mouse every ten seconds

I found a need to keep the computer from going to sleep/lock and security permissions didn't allow any installations. This solved that problem.

You can get the `JAR` file or download and build from the source.
