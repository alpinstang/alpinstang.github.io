Just in time for the new year I built an early version of Realm Defense, a simple tower defense game written in C# and built with Unity. This was a particularly fun project because I had to write some "dumb" AI for pathfinding. I ended up writing my own algorithm because the size of the game and the calculations required made A* or the more robust and "smarter" solutions overkill, and sacrificed my load time believe it or not.

This is a very early build with only one level. I would appreciate any feedback. Tweet at me or find me on [github](https://github.com/alpinstang/realm-defense/issues). *Happy New Year 2021!*

[Play Realm Defense](https://github.com/alpinstang/alpinstang.github.io/tree/main/content/blog/realm-defense/game)

You'll have to run it in localhost. Game on.
