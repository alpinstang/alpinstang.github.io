title: Welcome to my development blog!
---

Thanks for checking out my blog. It's written in jekyll based on the wonderful template from github user [barryclark](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). I write articles about things I encounter during development, as well as some personal musings and funny things I find online.

Please check out my [Portfolio] project page to see my background. That is written in jekyll as well and based on the awesome theme from [Long Do](https://github.com/longpdo).

For any questions or if you're looking for a developer, contact me through the links on there or through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnchristophermcdonald/).

Happy Coding!
