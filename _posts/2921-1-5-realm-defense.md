Just in time for the new year I built an early version of Realm Defense, a simple tower defense game written in C# and built with Unity.

This is a very early build with only one level. I would appreciate any feedback. Tweet at me or find me on [github](https://github.com/alpinstang/realm-defense/issues). *Happy New Year 2021!*

[Play Realm Defense](https://github.com/alpinstang/alpinstang.github.io/tree/main/content/blog/realm-defense/game)

You'll have to run it in localhost. Game on.
